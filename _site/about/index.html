    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        I have been making websites professionally for over 10 years, and have a wide variety of experience. As a developer at Cast Iron Coding in Portland, OR, I built sites for clients, and trained and supported them in their ongoing use. As the Web Editor and Electronic Communications Manager at UC Berkeley’s BAMPFA I helped to build and maintain their digital presence, as well as coordinated with contractors, co-workers, and students to achieve complex strategic and technical communications goals.

        <h3 class="socko text-5xl pr-1 pb-4 outline-text text-white tracking-wide">Research.</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">Your website is not the first website, and there is much to be learned from </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3 class="socko text-5xl pr-1 pb-4 outline-text text-white tracking-wide">Content.</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">High quality, well organized content is the foundation of a successful website. I can help you organize your content into a clear “information architecture” that will allow your users to easily find whatever they are looking for.</p>
    </div>    
    <div>
        <h3 class="socko text-5xl pr-1 pb-4 outline-text text-white tracking-wide">Design.</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">Good design makes a project shine, whether it is a new logo and identity, just the right font, or a comprehensive design system. Some design work I can do myself, sometimes it makes more sense to partner with a dedicated designer (or maybe you already have one in mind!).</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3 class="socko text-5xl pr-1 pb-4 outline-text text-white tracking-wide">Development.</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">I write code and build sites with an eye towards simplicity, usability and maintainability over the long term. Ideally, you could fire me and a new developer could come in and easily understand what I have built and how to continue with the work.</p>
    </div>    
    <div>
        <h3 class="socko text-5xl pr-1 pb-4 outline-text text-white tracking-wide">Support.</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">Many smaller organizations often don't have the expertise or resources to maintenance on their own after launch. I provide ongoing as-needed support to many clients.</p>
