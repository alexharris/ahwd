            An average project usually costs between $5000 and $25,000, depending on the particulars of what is needed, and takes 6-16 weeks. While no two jobs are alike, the process usually goes something like this:
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl uppercase font-bold">Discovery</h3>   
        <p>
            Many projects benefit from a robust phase in which we can work together to articulate your goals, discuss strategy, and create a plan.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl uppercase font-bold">Design</h3>   
        <p>
            For simple projects I can often do the design myself, for more involved projects or those requiring a rebrand, I will bring on a designer to work with us to make your site beautiful.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl uppercase font-bold">Build</h3>   
        <p>
            I use modern development practices to turn the designs into a performant, accessible site. I emphasize simple solutions that are robust and easily maintainable for the long haul.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl uppercase font-bold">Post-Launch</h3>   
        <p>
            I am committed to your projects success and happy to provide post-launch support, training and bug fixes.
        </p>   
        <h3 class="text-xl uppercase font-bold">A la carte</h3>   
        <p>
            Any of the above stages can be de-coupled from the process. I have been brought in on many projects just to do the "build" phase, and am happy to be a cog in someone else's machine. Likewise, for larger projects I might recommend a standalone "discovery" phase as its own project.

        <p>
            For most clients, especially in the arts and non-profit spaces, I often recommend the popular Wordpress CMS as a solution that allows non-technical users to maintain and update the content on their site. Maybe not a big surprise, seeing as how Wordpress is estimated to power over 40% of the modern web. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Many people who work with the web already have some experience with Wordpress. Additionally, It is supported by a large community of developers and hosting providers, as well as a wide array of plugins that can add extensive functionality.
