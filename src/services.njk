<p>An average project usually costs between $5000 and $25,000, depending on the particulars of what is needed, and takes 6-16 weeks. While no two jobs are alike, the process usually goes something like this:</p>

<div class="full-width grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4 mx-auto mt-16">
    <div class="card border border-blue-800 dark:border-white p-6 rounded-xl prose dark:prose-dark bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800">
        <h2 class="mb-2">1. Discovery</h2>
        <p>Many projects benefit from a robust phase in which we can work together to articulate your goals, discuss strategy, and create a plan.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card border border-blue-800 dark:border-white p-6 rounded-xl prose dark:prose-dark bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800">
        <h2 class="mb-2">2. Design</h2>
        <p>For simple projects I can often do the design myself, for more involved projects or those requiring a rebrand, I will bring on a designer to work with us to make your site beautiful.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card border border-blue-800 dark:border-white p-6 rounded-xl prose dark:prose-dark bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800">
        <h2 class="mb-2">3. Build</h2>
        <p>I use modern development practices to turn the designs into a performant, accessible site. I emphasize simple solutions that are robust and keep things simple and maintainable for the long term.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card border border-blue-800 dark:border-white p-6 rounded-xl prose dark:prose-dark bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800">
        <h2 class="mb-2">4. Launch</h2>
        <p>A good launch involves finalizing content entry, thorough QA, and a smooth go live process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card border border-blue-800 dark:border-white p-6 rounded-xl prose dark:prose-dark bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800">
        <h2 class="mb-2">5. Post-Launch</h2>
        <p>I am committed to your projects long term success and am happy to provide post-launch maintenance, support, training and bug fixes.</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="card border border-blue-800 dark:border-white p-6 rounded-xl prose dark:prose-dark bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800">
        <h2 class="mb-2">A la carte</h2>
        <p>Any of the above stages can be de-coupled from the rest of the process. I have been brought in on many projects just to do the "build" phase, and am a willing and communicative collaborator.</p>

<h2>A note on wordpress</h2>
<p>For most clients, especially in the arts and non-profit spaces, I often recommend the popular Wordpress CMS as a solution that allows non-technical users to maintain and update the content on their site. Maybe not a big surprise, seeing as how Wordpress is estimated to power over 40% of the modern web.</p>
<p>Many people who work with the web already have some experience with Wordpress. Additionally, It is supported by a large community of developers and hosting providers, as well as a wide array of plugins that can add extensive functionality.
