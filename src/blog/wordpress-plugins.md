{% bigtext %}A running list of Wordpress plugins that I like.{% endbigtext %}

I periodically take note of a plugin I find that I particularly like, which basically means it is simple, works well, and doesn't clutter the administrative interface. 


## [Post Duplicator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-duplicator/)

Just a simple plugin that makes it easy to duplicate posts. I am always surprised this is not a core Wordpress feature, but I am sure there is a reason. I like it both for initial content upload as well as for ongoing use by clients that aren't as familiar with the Wordpress admin interface.

## [Redirection](https://redirection.me/)

Works good

## [Footnotes Made Easy](https://wordpress.org/plugins/footnotes-made-easy/)

stuff
