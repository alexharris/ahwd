<h2 class="instrument-serif" >Process</h2>
<p>While no two jobs are alike, a typical process might go something like this:</p>

<div class="full-width grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4 mx-auto my-16">
    <div class="card">
        <h3 class="">1. Discovery</h3>
        <p>Many projects benefit from a robust phase in which we can work together to articulate your goals, discuss strategy, and create a plan.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h3 class="">2. Design</h3>
        <p>For simple projects, I can often do the design myself. For more involved projects or those requiring a rebrand, I will bring on a designer to work with us to make your site beautiful.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h3 class="">3. Build</h3>
        <p>I use modern development practices to turn the designs into a performant, accessible site. I emphasize solutions that are robust and keep things simple and maintainable for the long term.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h3 class="">4. Launch</h3>
        <p>A good launch involves finalizing content entry, thorough QA, and a smooth go-live process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h3 class="">5. Post-Launch</h3>
        <p>I am committed to your project's long-term success and am happy to provide post-launch maintenance, support, training, and bug fixes.</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="card">
        <h3 class="">6. A la carte</h3>
        <p>Any of the above stages can be de-coupled from the rest of the process. I have been brought in on many projects just to do the "build" phase, and am a willing and communicative collaborator.</p>
    </div>

An average project might costs between $5000 and $25,000, depending on the particulars of what is needed, and takes 6-16 weeks. Check out this [case study](/blog/cckw) to get an in-depth sense of how I think through solving client needs during a project


## About Me

I have been making websites professionally for over 10 years, and have been working exclusively as a freelancer and consultant for the past 4. Before setting out on my own, I experienced both sides of the client/contractor relationship. As a developer at Cast Iron Coding in Portland, OR, I helped build sites for clients, then trained and supported them in their ongoing use. As the Web Editor and Electronic Communications Manager at UC Berkeley’s BAMPFA I hired and worked with contractors to achieve BAMPFA'S strategic and technical communications goals. These dual experiences helped me understand how to make compelling websites come to life and effectively serve my clients.
