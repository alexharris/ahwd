While no two jobs are alike, a typical process might go something like this:

<div class="full-width grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4 mx-auto my-16">
    <div class="card border border-blue-800 dark:border-white p-6 rounded-xl prose dark:prose-dark bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800">
        <h2 class="mb-2">1. Discovery</h2>
        <p>Many projects benefit from a robust phase in which we can work together to articulate your goals, discuss strategy, and create a plan.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card border border-blue-800 dark:border-white p-6 rounded-xl prose dark:prose-dark bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800">
        <h2 class="mb-2">2. Design</h2>
        <p>For simple projects I can often do the design myself, for more involved projects or those requiring a rebrand, I will bring on a designer to work with us to make your site beautiful.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card border border-blue-800 dark:border-white p-6 rounded-xl prose dark:prose-dark bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800">
        <h2 class="mb-2">3. Build</h2>
        <p>I use modern development practices to turn the designs into a performant, accessible site. I emphasize simple solutions that are robust and keep things simple and maintainable for the long term.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card border border-blue-800 dark:border-white p-6 rounded-xl prose dark:prose-dark bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800">
        <h2 class="mb-2">4. Launch</h2>
        <p>A good launch involves finalizing content entry, thorough QA, and a smooth go live process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card border border-blue-800 dark:border-white p-6 rounded-xl prose dark:prose-dark bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800">
        <h2 class="mb-2">5. Post-Launch</h2>
        <p>I am committed to your projects long term success and am happy to provide post-launch maintenance, support, training and bug fixes.</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="card border border-blue-800 dark:border-white p-6 rounded-xl prose dark:prose-dark bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-800">
        <h2 class="mb-2">A la carte</h2>
        <p>Any of the above stages can be de-coupled from the rest of the process. I have been brought in on many projects just to do the "build" phase, and am a willing and communicative collaborator.</p>
    </div>                         
</div>

An average project usually costs between $5000 and $25,000, depending on the particulars of what is needed, and takes 6-16 weeks. Check out this [case study](/blog/cckw) to get an in-depth sense of how I think through solving client needs during a project

## About Me

I have been making websites professionally for over 10 years, and have been working exclusively as a freelancer and consultant for the past 4. Before setting out on my own, I experienced both sides of the client/contractor relationship. As a developer at Cast Iron Coding in Portland, OR, I helped build sites for clients, then trained and supported them in their ongoing use. As the Web Editor and Electronic Communications Manager at UC Berkeleyâ€™s BAMPFA I hired and worked with contractors to achieve BAMPFA'S strategic and technical communications goals. These dual experiences helped me understand how to make compelling websites come to life and effectively serve my clients.
