## Overview
We have been working with 500 Capp Street on a regular basis since 2018 to keep their website up and running and adapting it to suit their needs as their organization has grown and changed over that time. Over the years, this has included migrating the site to a modern Wordpress hosting platform with improved security and backups, rebuilding the site templates from scratch, redoing the information architecture, advising on content strategies, building an online publication, training new staff, and more.

## The Cabinet
The Cabinet is a web-based publication for artists to engage with David Ireland's work. We designed the site in tandem with 500 Capp Street staff to turn their vision into a functional, usable web design, built custom Wordpress post templates to display the content, and then trained staff on how to prepare and enter the content. The result has been a long lasting addition to their online offerings, adding another path for visitors to engage with David Ireland's work.
