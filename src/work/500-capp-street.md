I have been working with 500 Capp Street on a regular basis since 2018 to keep their website up and running and adapting it to suit their needs as their organization has grown and changed over that time. Over the years, this has included migrating the site to a modern Wordpress hosting platform with improved security and backups, rebuilding the site templates from scratch, redoing the information architecture, advising on content strategies, building an online publication, training new staff, and more.
