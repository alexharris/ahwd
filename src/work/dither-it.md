Dither it! is a web application that reduces the number of colors an image uses, using various algorithms, providing a particular "lo-fi" aesthetic and often a reduced file size. Built using Vue.js and tailwind, I have been maintaining and updating Dither it! since 2019. In that time, over 135,000 visitors have dithered images over a million times. 

There is also a Dither it! Figma plugin.
