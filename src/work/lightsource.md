Lightsource, a fine art printer and digital imaging business in San Francisco, needed a new website with an updated look and a custom e-commerce experience that would allow customers to attach image assets directly to their orders, reducing friction for the user and administrative complexity for order fulfillment. This took the form of a fully custom Wordpress theme, and a checkout workflow that integrates Uploadcareâ€™s file uploader api with the Woocommerce e-commerce platform.
