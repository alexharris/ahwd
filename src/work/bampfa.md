## Overview
Working in house as the Web Editor and Electronic Communications Manager at BAMPFA I spent over 4 years running all facets of their web presence, including a difficult move from an old php site to a newer Drupal one, migrating data, managing contractors, staff and students, building Drupal templates, developing and managing web style guidelines, running the email marketing program, building digital interfaces for physical signage throughout the museum..and probably a lot of other stuff too!

## Data Entry Madness
One of the big challenges with BAMPFA wass dealing with the amount of data that flows into the website. With nightly movies, events, and exhibitions there is a LOT going on. Managing these ongoing data entry provided a lot about of lessons about what makes for a good workflow, and maybe even more so what makes for a bad workflow.
