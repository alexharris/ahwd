Canal Projects is a new contemporary art institution in New York which opened in 2022. I was brought on to this project to help build out the templates and admin interface for the new Kirby CMS site. Many arts organizations have similar needs when it comes to listing events and information on their site, and this one was no different. Kirby is a CMS that lets you create fully custom admin interfaces, so we could create admin pages that would be intuitive for the new staff to use. The site also uses best practices around semantic markup, accessibility, and performance.
