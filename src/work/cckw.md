## Overview
Chen Chen & Kai Williams is a New York design studio that wanted a new site to go along with the release of a line of furniture and lighting. They wanted a robust and modular CMS that was easy to reconfigure to incorporate new products and categories as they were released. They also wanted the ability to incorporate their existing Shopify e-commerce into the site.

## Solution
Modern Wordpress with Advanced Custom Fields and custom post types provides the robustness and community of Wordpress with the flexibility and content modeling functionality of newer CMSes. Using this, we were able to provide a robust solution to their current content needs, and the flexibility to modify things as needed going forwarded. In addition, we built a custom shopping cart solution based on existing Shopify integration that provides easy and powerful e-commerce functionality.
