summary: A chemical sensors company in Berkeley, CA, that just launched its next generation handheld mercury monitor
---

Picoyune is a chemical sensors company in Berkeley that just launched its next generation handheld mercury monitor, the MA-1. This straight forward and functional website highlights the new product and provides a form to drive sales. The site, which is only two pages, is built with simple HTML and CSS, with the form handled by Netlify's form functionality. This makes it dead simple to update and maintain for now, until the company grows into needing something more complex.
