## Overview
Picoyune is a chemical sensors company in Berkeley, CA that hired us to help go to market with their next generation handheld mercury monitor, the MA-1. 

They wanted a straight forward, no muss no fuss site that would let interested customers learn about the MA-1 and easily start the purchase process.

## Solution
This straight forward and functional website highlights the new product and provides a form to drive sales. The site, which is only a few pages, is built with simple, static HTML, with the form handled by Netlify's form functionality. This makes it dead simple to update and maintain for now, until the company grows into needing something more complex.
