Kessenick Gamma wanted a new look and more sophisticated web presence to highlight their work and appeal to prospective new hires. Working with a designer, we redid their whole visual identity from the ground up, including a new website, branding, photography, content, business cards, even email signatures. The site is built on Wordpress, with a strong and simple foundation that can grow as their business does.
