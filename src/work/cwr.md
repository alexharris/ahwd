Camp Winnarainbow is a sleepover camp in Mendocino, CA that is focued on helping "children from all backgrounds develop community, self-confidence, and artistry through circus and performing arts." This project was a comprehensive overhaul of their outdated site and visual identity. It included a new logo and colors and a new site that features video, easy access to important content and lively colors that reflect the camp's energy. I also worked with the camp staff to completely re-write the site's content, based on research of industry standard information architecture with a goal of clear communication of both the big ideas and small details that visitors should know. The majority of site content is based on a variety of re-usable custom Wordpress blocks that will allow the site to easily add rich pages as it grows.
