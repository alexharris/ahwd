    <p>AHWD is the freelance web development practice of Alex Harris, located in Oakland, CA.</p>
    <h2 class="text-xl uppercase font-bold star">Experience</h2>
    <p>I have been making websites professionally for over 10 years, and have been working exclusively as a freelancer and consultant for the past 4. Before setting out on my own, I experienced both sides of the client/contractor relationship: As a developer at Cast Iron Coding in Portland, OR, I helped build sites for clients, and trained and supported them in their ongoing use, and as the Web Editor and Electronic Communications Manager at UC Berkeleyâ€™s BAMPFA I hired contractors and worked with them to achieve complex strategic and technical communications goals.</p>
