            Hello, I'm Alex. I have been making websites professionally for over 10 years, and have a wide variety of experience. As a developer at Cast Iron Coding in Portland, OR, I built sites for clients, and trained and supported them in their ongoing use. As the Web Editor and Electronic Communications Manager at UC Berkeleyâ€™s BAMPFA I helped to build and maintain their digital presence, as well as coordinated with contractors, co-workers, and students to achieve complex strategic and technical communications goals. I have been out on my own since 2018, and am looking forward to helping you with your website.
